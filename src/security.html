<h1>Security at Scanpay</h1>

<p>
  We have built our system from the ground up, with a security by design approach, making security considerations the core of our engineering process. You can therefore rest assured that we have implemented multiple layers of security to protect your data. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to <a href="mailto:security@scanpay.dk">contact us</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="transport-layer-security">Data protection</h3>
<p>
  We are fully compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). Sensitive data is encrypted with AES-256-GCM and stored in multiple data centers within the European Union. The encryption key is protected with <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing">Shamir's Secret Sharing</a> and only a few trusted employees have a <i>share</i> of the key. Three shares (employees) are needed to decrypt and access your data.
</p>

<p>
  In our daily operations we share sensitive data with the following third parties:

<h3 id="basic-authentication">Basic authentication</h3>
<p>
  All API requests have to be authenticated via <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication">HTTP Basic Auth</a> with API keys as credentials. API keys are unique and they contain your shopid and a random key, i.e. <code class="code">shopid:key</code>. If you use our API client libraries or e-commerce modules then we will take care of the authentication.

<h3 id="pci-dss">PCI DSS</h3>
<p>
  The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a security standard for businesses that store, process or transmit credit cards. PCI DSS is a continuous process and since 2017, we have successfully completed two level 1 certifications and one SAQ D certification. You can view our current Attestation of Compliance (AOC) <a rel="nofollow" href="https://scanpay.dk/pdf/AOC.pdf">here</a>.
