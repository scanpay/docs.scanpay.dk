<h1>Payment Window</h1>

<p>
  The payment window is where your customers enter their payment details. The payment window is accessed through <a href="/payment-link">payment links</a>. You can either redirect the customer to the payment window, or you can embed the window in your website or app.
</p>

<p>
  The payment window is extremely lightweight and probably the fastest in the world, but more importantly, it is auditable, secure and stable. For security and privacy reasons, we do not use any third-party frameworks or services.

<h2 id="request-headers">Error messages</h2>
<p>
  Error messages are displayed in the payment window. Unfortunately, banks are inconsistent and unpredictable, but we do our very best to parse and translate their error codes. Here is a complete list of error messages that customers can receive in our payment window:
